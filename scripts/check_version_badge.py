"""README version badge vs. manifest.json — consistency check.

Directly motivated by a real drift found during this project's own
v3.4.2 work: the README's version badge stayed at "3.4.0" through two
subsequent releases before being noticed and fixed by hand. This is a
DIFFERENT check from release.yml's "manifest.json version matches git
tag" step — that one only runs at release time, against the tag; this
one runs on every push to main, against the actual current README text,
so drift can't sit unnoticed between releases the way it did before.

Exit 0 = badge matches manifest.json. Exit 1 = mismatch, printed to stdout.
